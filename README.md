# Assignment_7_PuttingItAllTogether

Your task is to implement, document, and demonstrate a workflow / pipeline that includes at minimum the following practices: 

    Code development (Intelij)
    Distributed version control (GitHub)
    Unit testing (JUnit)
    Build automation (Maven)
    Continuous integration / continuous delivery (Jenkins)
    Container / virtual machine export (Docker)

Recommended tools are noted in parentheses alongside each concept. You are free to use other tools with similar functionality in your workflow if they work better for you.

The deliverable for this project is a recorded demonstration (audio and screenshare / slideshow required; video optional) of your integrated software development pipeline which utilizes the concepts and tools noted here. Your demonstration should walk us through the steps of your workflow on your workstation, from local code development to distributed version control to unit testing to build automation to CI/CD to build export or some approximation thereof. The order of operations here is fluid, so don't worry about demonstrating these concepts in precisely this order if some other order makes more sense to you. As long as all of the pieces are there, the project requirements will be met. There is no length requirement; a thorough demonstration might take around ten minutes. Your presentation might be a bit longer or shorter, but it should demonstrate the full process.

The purpose of this project is to focus on your workflow so in this case, utilizing code from a previous assignment or other class is perfectly fine - we don't need to generate a new / original program.
